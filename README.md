# PyHoliday
The repository is home to the PyHoliday module. The module makes use of requests and BeautifulSoup4 to create a web scraping application. 
The user can enter the destinations and dates of their holiday tour and the module opens all websites relevant for travel, stay, food and
entertainment and fills out the necessary details. The user only has to choose among the varied options and the tour is planned at the click
of a button. No hasles!
